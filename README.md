# Movie-Recommendation-System
Movie Recommendation System - Unsupervised Machine Learning technique

In this project, I imported datasets from 2 files named "movies" and "credits" (containing info about the cast and crew along with movie titles)
Then I merged them in the "title" column and used a combined data set to build a recommendation system.

I performed "Data Cleaning" and "Exploratory Data Analysis" to get only significant columns to build the desired model.
I used 'ast' function to extract meaningful information from column values.

I used the "Bag of Words" feature extraction technique for feature extraction considering text data.

Further, I used cosine similarity to build a similarity matrix, to pick recommendations based on similarity score.
